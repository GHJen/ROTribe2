## ROTribe
ROTribe is a website designed to let users engage in self-enquiry work via an online journal. While many places exist to store documents, this was set up to be simple and to hold users accountable to only engaging in 5-minutes of journaling at a time, which can be the most difficult part of starting a self-enquiry practice.

Each new entry has input fields for a prompt (the question or statement that starts the curent entry) and the entry itself. Users have free-reign to type in the prompt, but a 5 minute timer, visible beneath the form, starts counting down as soon as users start typing in the space for the main entry. If a user hasn't already pressed the submit button when the timer runs out, the entry will be automatically submitted.

Additionally, users may access all entries in their journal. Clicking on the entry will expand so that a user can read all of what they've written (prior, they only see a prompt, snippet, and date of entry). Entries can be removed and tags can be added to each entry. Finally, users can filter their journals by tag(s) if they're searching for something specific.

This was what I had envisioned when starting to create this website, and I have since been interested in eventually building out a more robust learning management system so that users can track work, build upon skills they've learned, and interact with instructors, ideally for use in a variety of therapeutic or meditative modalities.

Note: This was based on Fullstack/MIT's boilerplate code!
